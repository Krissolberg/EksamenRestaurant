        <h1>Assignment module 5: Technology and sustainability</h1>

        <p>The most relevant goal for us in our career would be the UNs sustainable development goal: 13 Climate action. 
            Climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our times. 
            It’s a challenge that will be relevant no matter what industry you work in. 
        </p>

    
        <ol class="topical-list" type="1">
            <li>Cement production is one of the key sources of emission of CO2. Capturing these emissions local would reduce emissions substantially. By using a device that can capture and separate the CO2 from the other gases you are able to store the CO2 away from the atmosphere. </li>
            <li>Until 150 years ago nobody had cars. Cars extremely polluting it would be beneficial for the climate if we went back to zero cars. Reward the use of different methods of transportation and further forbid the use of cars.</li>
            <li>Reduce the amount of childbirth by educating women in developing countries. Giving women the opportunity to educate themselves from a young age would make more women prioritize work and career. This would reduce childbirth. Since the culture is keeping women at home with the children it would be necessary to force a drastically change of the culture. </li>
            <li>Reduce meat consumption. Animal agriculture is a major source of emissions. By compensating farmers more so they can reduce the amount of meat production we would be reducing the availability of meat to the people. </li>
            <li>Reduce the use of plastic by forbidding companies to use of plastic packaging and reward recycling. </li>
            <li>Increase the taxes on plane traveling to incentivize the use of green transportation.</li>
            <li>Reduce food waste by planning food purchases and reusing leftovers in new meals.</li>
            <li>Stop deforesting by making laws against deforesting and forbidding expands of meat production. Forests are major carbon sinks. By deforesting we release a lot of stored carbon into the atmosphere. </li>
            <li>Increase transportation of goods by train. Increased taxes on plane traveling would indirectly force companies to use more economic ways of transporting goods. By lowering the prices of train transportation this would be an obvious choice.</li>
            <li>Plant more trees to capture excess of carbon. It is important that the trees planted would be maintenance free as maintaining them would mean use of equipment that would erase the carbon absorption. </li>
            <li>Turn off the lights whenever you leave the room to reduce the amount of energy used.</li>
            <li>Turn down the heat at home to reduce the amount of energy used. </li>
            <li>Build more energy efficient buildings by building high lifespan buildings with good properties.</li>
            <li>Increase use and lifespan of rechargeable batteries by banning nonchargeable batteries. </li>
            <li>Decommission all coal power plants. </li>
            <li>Reduce usage of construction steel, by using wood instead. </li>
            <li>Reduce consumption. Producing things emits climate gasses. By buying only what’s necessary and buying used from others.</li>
            <li>Solar panels on buildings. Access to renewable energy decreases the use of nonrenewable energy.</li>
            <li>Battery powered shipping. Shipping industry is one of the biggest emitters due to the use of fossil fuels.</li>
            <li>Shipping through the Northwest passage would reduce the distance and therefore reduce the number of emissions produced. As of now ships need an icebreaker escort to get through the due to lots of ice, but by implementing the icebreaker into the ships they would be able to break the ice on their own. </li>
            <li>Work from home. Less energy spent on commuting, and less energy used in office buildings. </li>
            <li>Reduce excessive irrigation. With the production of avocados in Spain the usage of water has increased rapidly, which is resulting in lack of water. Forbidding productions that rely heavily on water. </li>
            <li>Reduce life expectancy. High life expectancy means more years to pollute. Encourage smoking would decrease life expectancy drastically. The number of emissions from production and use of cigarettes wouldn’t compare to the reduction of emissions caused by a lower life expectancy.</li>
            <li>Build public transportation infrastructure. In the USA there’s lack of access to public transportation which is resulting in unnecessary private cars. When a public transportation infrastructure is in place it would be possible to forbid the use of private cars. </li>
            <li>Incentivize biking. Biking is pollution free compared to other methods of transportation. By facilitating biking, it is faster and cheaper than other types of transportation.</li>
            <li>Educate the population of developing countries to make them help solve the climate challenges. Start the education from a young age and make it possible for online education would increase the amount of people solving the climate challenges around the globe. </li>
            <li>Sustainable food production. By designing more energy efficient and water efficient manufacturing sites it would be possible to use natural resources more efficiently. </li>
            <li>Sharing economy. More people sharing the same resources is causing less pollution.</li>
            <li>Self-sufficiency is reducing production of goods and services. Reducing the availability of goods and services would force people to be self-sufficient. </li>
            <li>Increase transparency. By increasing transparency countries and companies can hold each other accountable.</li>
        </ol>
