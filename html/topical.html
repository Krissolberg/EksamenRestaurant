            Email security and EML-rendering
        </h1>
        
        <p>
            This is two paragraphs from a report written by student s331305 autumn 2022 in the subject "IT project in practice".
        </p>
        
        <h2>
            Email security
        </h2>
        
        <p>
            Email is a quick and easy way to communicate on a variety of devices, 
            this makes email the most common way to communicate in organizations and firms,
            thereby also making it the largest current attack surface. 
            Once an email is intercepted it can be read on any device without decryption.
            <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/email-security">[1]</a> 
            Emails can also be manipulated in the content, as well as who the sender and receiver is. 
            The types of email attacks are phishing, spam and spoofing. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Phishing</em> is an attack where a malicious actor sends messages pretending to be a trusted person or entity. 
            Phishing messages manipulate users into installing malicious files, 
            clicking malicious links or giving away sensitive information such as access credentials. 
            <a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber-hub/threat-prevention/what-is-phishing/">[2]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Spam</em> is unsolicited and unwanted junk email sent out to a large number of people. 
            Spam can also contain malicious content which is trying to gain access to your computer.
            <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/email-security/what-is-spam.html">[3]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Spoofing</em> is an attack which is trying to fool the recipient into thinking the email 
            is coming from someone other than the apparent sender. 
            Spoofing can be used to gain access to a targets personal information, 
            spread malware through infected links or attachments and much more.
            <a href="https://www.forcepoint.com/cyber-edu/spoofing">[4]</a>

            What can we do to make the communication through email more secure?

                    <li class="sublist2info" style="list-style-type: none;">
                        We use spam filters, which make the spam received go straight to our junk folder so we never see it. 
                    </li>   
                
                    <li>

                    </li>
                    <li class="sublist2info" style="list-style-type: none;">
                        Antivirus protection should be used so we get clear warnings if an email might contain malicious content. 
                    </li>
                
                    <li>

                         acts like a proxy for an organization’s email server. In short terms the organization sets up a DNS MX record to point towards the SEG. 
                         This redirects all incoming emails to the SEG which then can filter and inspect the email for malicious content. If the email gets cleared, the SEG will forward it to the corporate email server for delivery to the intended receiver.

                        Employee education is a large part of email security. 
                        Surveys show that employees forget what they have learned within 3 to 4 months, so they need continuous recaps.

        <h2>
            EML-file (electronic mail) rendering 
        </h2>
        
        <p>
            As the whole project builds around an EML-file it is important to understand what an EML-file is and how it is built up. 
            EML is a file extension for an email message saved to a file in the Internet Message Format protocol for electronic mail messages. 
            It is the standard format used by Microsoft Outlook Express as well as some other email programs. 
            Since EML files are created to comply with industry standard RFC 5322, EML files can be used with most email clients, servers and applications.
            <a href="https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000388.shtml">[7]</a> 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            EML files typically store each message as a single file (unlike MBOX which concatenates all the messages from a folder into one file), 
            and attachments may either be included as MIME content in the message or written off as a separate file, referenced from a marker in the EML-file. 
        </p>

        <div id="images">
            <img src="../images/emlcode1.png" class="image">
            <p>Figure 2.2.1</p>
        </div>
        <div id="images">
            <img src="../images/emlcode2.png" class="image">
            <p>Figure 2.2.2</p>
        </div>
        <div id="images">
            <img src="../images/emlcode3.png" class="image">
            <p>Figure 2.2.3</p>
        </div>
        

        
        <p>
            As we can see from figure 2.2.1-3 above when opening an EML-file there is lots of text and it is difficult and takes time to get the relevant information from it. 
            We can see that the EML-file contains different parts where on the top we have the meta data, then you get information about the transfer encoding and content type. Then you get information about different receivers of the email and what host it is received from. Further down we have another content-type and a part which tells us what the attachment is and what it is named. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            When rendering this EML-file into an image we can clearly see in figure 2.2.4 below, all the relevant information and get a clear understanding of how much unnecessary information
            the EML-file contains.
        </p>
